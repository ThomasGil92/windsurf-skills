# VERCEL_SKILLS

A tiny collection of one-line commands to install **Windsurf Skills** from https://skills.sh/.

The only goal of this repo: find a skill you care about in `./skills/`, then **copy/paste the command** into your project to install it.

## Usage

Open a file in `./skills/` and copy the `npx skills add ...` line.
